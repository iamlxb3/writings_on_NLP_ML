>  Statement vs claim vs proposition

A statement is indeed a sentence which can be true or false. A proposition is a statement that the author is proposing for further scrutiny, possibly a proof. A claim is a proposition that the author claims is true. The differences are merely subtle characterizations by the author -- all are statements.

> vital = decisive (as if between life and death)
> imperative = urgent, pressing (as if of an obligation)
> essential = fundamental, necessary 
> important = of great significance.
