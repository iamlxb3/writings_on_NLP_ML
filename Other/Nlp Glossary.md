Definiteness:

> In linguistics, **definiteness** is a semantic feature of noun phrases (NPs), distinguishing between referents/entities that are identifiable in a given context (definite noun phrases) and entities which are not (indefinite noun phrases).
>
> For example, the definite noun phrase "the waiter" refers to a specific person, as opposed to the indefinite noun phrase containing the indefinite article "a" which introduces ambiguity.

Semantic Head

> The word dog is the head of big red dog since it determines that the phrase is a noun phrase, not an adjective phrase.
