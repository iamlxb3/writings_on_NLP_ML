A Self-Training Approach for Short Text Clustering:

1. Self-training on K-means constructed pseudo labels using DEC loss
2. Self-supervised
3. Semi-supervised clustering

Discovering New Intents via Constrained Deep Adaptive Clustering with Cluster Refinement:

1. Pair-wise similarity
2. Semi-supervised clustering

Dialog Intent Induction with Deep Multi-View Clustering

1. Relies on K-means
2. Two views of data
3. Alternating training

Semi-supervised Clustering for Short Text via Deep Representation Learning

1. loss function K-means combines pseudo labels and ground-truth labels
