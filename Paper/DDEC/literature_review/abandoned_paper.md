Title: Towards Open Intent Discovery for Conversational Text
Reason: 

1. The paper is interesting because it does not frame intent to span a whole sentence, rather it define intent as a combination of Action tagged phrases followed by Object tagged phrases. We can solve the intent discovery problem solving the sequence tagging problem. However, it can be difficult to be integrated into the mainstream "intent discovery framework"; we lack data with sequence labels.
